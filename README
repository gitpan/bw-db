BW::DB is the dataabse module for BW-Lib. 

BW::DB provides a simple wrapper for DBI. Currently it only supports 
DBD::mysql. PostgreSQL and SQLite support is planned for the near
future. 

NOTE: Please do not use BW::DB::CRUD for any new coding. It's unfinished 
and the interface WILL change in the future. 

See INSTALL for installation instructions.
